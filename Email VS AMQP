How Does AMQP Message Brokering Differ From E-Mailing?

Given that mailing consists of sending of a message (i.e. publishing), its reception and processing by the mail server 
(i.e. brokering) to relevant mailboxes (i.e. queues) finally followed by requesting and obtaining the said message (i.e. consuming), 
the process and the task of transferring messages defined by AMQP can be seen as similar.

Besides the fundamentals actually differing quite a bit, the main thing that separates AMQP from e-mailing is the targeted Quality 
of Service (QoS). AMQP, by its nature, strives for reliability, security, standards compliance and safety.

Features such as persistence, delivery of a message to multiple consumers, possibility to ensure and prevent multiple consumption,
and the protocol operating at high-speeds are the main factors separating the two.

For business-level usage and adaption, the requirements for authentication to sending messages (i.e. publishing) to exchanges
(and queues) means prevention of unwanted ones (such as spam), playing a key role for establishing the QoS.
